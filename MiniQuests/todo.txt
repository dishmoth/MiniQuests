General:
- Author screen?
- Maybe shouldn't save when going into room D19???

Applet:
- Resizable?

Android:
- Investigate frame rate
- Separate thread for loading sounds?
- Keys to support D-pad

Possibly:
- Executable jar (resizable, avoids applets).
- Redraw some of the stairs?
- Can't tell if enemies take damage.
- Can accidentally solve puzzles.

Crash:
- Seg fault on "Galaxy S" (probably nothing?).

Bugs:
- Wrong number of stars?!  Can't reproduce

Deployment checklist:
- For beta, freeze score screen (in EndStory).
- For beta, disable escape (in KeyMonitorApplet/KeyMonitorDesktop).
- For beta, disable save (in EnvBitsApplet/EnvBitsGdx).
- For beta, enable stats reporting (in Env.report()).
- For desktop, export Runnable JAR with "Package required libraries...".
- Turn off recolour mapping.
- Update version in debug (applet and gdx) and readme.
- Update save version (SaveState.kVersion and in SaveState.decode()).
- Update to latest libgdx.
- Update version numbers in Android manifest.
- Set "debuggable=false" in Android manifest.

Dungeon 4:
- D02: Make the tree clearer; make it obvious when something happens; make it clearer what happens.
- More contrast for monster wave colours in D19.
- More subdued colours in D19 (and elsewhere?).
